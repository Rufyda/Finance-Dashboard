## 📖 About the Project  
We are a team of four ambitious women 🌍✨ who met virtually from different countries and time zones. Despite never meeting in person, we managed to collaborate, brainstorm, and build our first **Power BI Finance Dashboard** together.  

This project is not only about analyzing numbers—it’s about telling the story behind the data and practicing real teamwork across borders.

## 📊 Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains sales and profit data for different products across multiple market segments and countries (2013–2014).  

- **Products:** Carretera, Montana, Paseo, Velo, VTT, Amarilla  
- **Segments:** Government, Midmarket, Enterprise, Channel Partners, Small Business  
- **Time Period:** 2013–2014  

---

## 🔎 Key Insights  

- **Carretera** → Stable sales with big spikes in **Oct & Dec 2014**, possibly due to campaigns or seasonal demand.  
- **Montana** → High sales at low prices gave good profits, while high prices (with fewer units) generated **huge margins**.  
- **Paseo, Velo, VTT** → Discounts played a major role. Low discount bands boosted sales volume but had a smart impact on profits.  
- **Profit vs. Sales** → Some low-priced products drove high sales but lower profits, showing the importance of balancing **price vs. volume**.  
- **Seasonality** → June & December 2014 showed peak sales and profits, likely due to campaigns or seasonal effects.  

👉 Every number has a meaning, every month has a story. Data visualization helped us uncover market behavior and smarter strategies.
